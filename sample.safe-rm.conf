# This is a sample configuration file for safe-rm.
# By default, you could copy this file to ~/.safe-rm.conf

#
# If you want to use a trash directory other than the default system trash,
#   uncomment the line after divider `-----*`
#   and set the path to the desired trash directory.
# By default, safe-rm will use the system trash.

# If you want to permanently delete files that are already in the trash,
#   uncomment the line after divider `-----*`
# It defaults to 'no'.
# Pay attention that any value that starts with 'y' or 'Y' will be treated as 'yes'.

#
# If you want to disable the use of AppleScript for moving files to the trash,
#   uncomment the line after divider `-----*`
